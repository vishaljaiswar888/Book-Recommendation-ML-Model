## Book Recommendation ML Model
- This is end-to-end Book Recommendation Machine Learning Model which show five very much similar books based on the one user selects from the list of books.

- In the background I had merged all the tags and keywords for every book and had created a single-single list for every books. Then I had used Counter Vectorizer, which creates a 3D vectors of all the lists and when we select any book it looks at it's vector and five nearest vectors to it. Then displays the name of the books as per their vectors.

- Interface is made using pythonâ€™s flask web framework.

## Models used
- Linear Regression - (82.55% r2_score)

- Lasso - (81.31% r2_score)

- Ridge - (82.46% r2_score)

- As per the above r2_scores, Linear Regression and Ridge where performing a bit better than Lasso. That's why for building the web framework I chose Ridge ML Model with 82.46% r2_score.
